Odd/miscellaneous demos for v1.9 PC Doom/Doom II games

Demo files by Ledmeister (ledmeister@aol.com), available at
http://classicdoom.com/odddemos.htm

To use demos from DOS: Copy the demo files into your game's
directory (i.e. Doom2, Doom95, TNT, etc.); then in DOS
mode, switch into your game's directory.

From this point, demo playback commands will vary slightly,
depending on which game the demos were made for.

For Doom 1 or Ultimate Doom demos, type

doom -playdemo DEMONAME

where DEMONAME is the filename (minus the ".LMP") of the
demo you want to see.  For example, type

doom -playdemo impfight

at the DOS prompt in your game's directory to play the demo
IMPFIGHT.LMP.

For Doom II or Final Doom demos, type

doom2 -playdemo DEMONAME

where DEMONAME is the filename (minus the ".LMP") of the
demo you want to see.  For example, type

doom2 -playdemo dedngone

at the DOS prompt in your game's directory to play the demo
DEDNGONE.LMP.

For Doom II Master Levels demos, type

doom2 -file WADNAME.wad -playdemo DEMONAME

where WADNAME is the filename of the Master Levels WAD that
you want to use (which must also be in the same directory),
and DEMONAME is the filename (minus the ".LMP") of the demo
you want to see.  For example, type

doom2 -file combine.wad -playdemo combslip

at the DOS prompt in your game's directory to play the demo
COMBSLIP.LMP.
